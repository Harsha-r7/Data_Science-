## Summary and Conclusion

Google Play Store is renowned as one of the largest and most popular Android app stores worldwide. With its extensive collection of apps and a wealth of data, it presents an optimal opportunity for creating effective models and identifying trends and future challenges.

In this EDA project, I have ulized two raw datasets from Kaggle: one containing Play Store attributes and the other consisting of user reviews. The first dataset encompasses 13 different attributes, while the second dataset provides five additional features for data manipulation and analysis.

To ensure data integrity,  began by performing crucial data cleaning steps. This involved removing duplicate entries and dropping non-essential null values. However, due to a large number of null values in the rating column (1645), dropping them entirely would have adversely affected the final results. Therefore, just replaced these null values with the mode of ratings.

After cleaning the data, I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain a comprehensive understanding of our dataset. This involved various analyses, such as examining the number of installations for each category and exploring the correlation between app size, Android version, and the number of installs.
